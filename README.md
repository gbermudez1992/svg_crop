![SVG Crop](dist/images/twitter.png)

## Remove blank space from around any SVG instantly.

### Contributions

Open up an issue! Then:

- Clone and run `yarn && yarn start:dev` 
- Submit a PR (I can then build and deploy it on my end)

Note that I've committed the `/dist` directory for now since I haven't mapped the `index.html` or any of the images from `/src` so they live in `/dist` and therefore in source control for now.
